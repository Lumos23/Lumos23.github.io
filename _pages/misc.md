### Service
I co-run the Princeton AI Alignment and Safety Seminar ([PASS](https://evaleval.github.io/accepted_papers/EvalEval_24_He.pdf)). You should check out talk recordings from our amazing speakers [here](https://www.youtube.com/@PrincetonPLI)! At Princeton, I am also a member of the CS department's graduate student committee. 


I have been a reviewer for conferences like NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, and ACM FAccT.
