Hi! I'm Luxi He (feel free to call me Lucy). I'm a second-year CS Ph.D. student at Princeton University, where I'm fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. Danqi Chen](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~danqic/) and [Prof. Peter Henderson](https://www.peterhenderson.co/). My current research focuses on understanding language models and improving their **alignment and safety**. I'm particularly interested in the **impact of data** in the language model life cycle, as well as making language models more **reliable and trustworthy**. Recently, I've also been exploring multimodal and reasoning-related topics. Motivated by real-world impact and my hope to bridge the gap between tech and policy, I want to bring in insights from both technical and policy sides to my research.

Before Princeton, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from Harvard in 2023 with Highest Honors in Computer Science & Mathematics and a concurrent Master's in Applied Math. 

Outside of research, I'm a singer, dancer, photographer, and amateur food blogger.
