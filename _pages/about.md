Hi! I'm Luxi He (feel free to call me Lucy). I'm currently a CS Ph.D. student at Princeton University, where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Danqi Chen](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~danqic/) and [Prof. Peter Henderson](https://www.peterhenderson.co/). My current research focuses on understanding language models and improving their alignment and safety.  I'm particularly interested in the **impact of data** in the language model life cycle, as well as **safe deployment of models**. Motivated by real-world implications and my hope to bridge the gap between tech and policy, I'm also exploring law and policy-driven research questions, such as copyright problems in generative models. 

Before Princeton, I graduated from Harvard in 2023 with Highest Honors in Computer Science & Mathematics and a concurrent Master's in Applied Math. 

Outside of research, I'm a singer, dancer, photographer, and amateur food blogger.
